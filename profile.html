    <h3>Career goals:</h3>

    <p> Since deciding to go into the tech industry last year I have changed what I look for in a career. First and most importantly I want a career that will support me and my family for now and our future. I want to be able to take my family on trips and fund any activities they become interested in.
        I want to get my first job in the tech world and learn and grow my skills as much as possible. After a few years I hope to move up to some bigger companies or bigger roles in software engineering. I want to learn many different aspects of coding and many different languages. I want to enjoy my job each day and look forward to the work I am doing. While also being proud of the work I am completing.
